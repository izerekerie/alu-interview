# Rainwater Trapping Problem

This project solves the **Rainwater Trapping** problem, where given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width, the goal is to calculate how much water is retained after it rains.

## Problem Description

You are given a list of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a wall in a relief map (cross-section view). Each unit in the list has a width of 1. The challenge is to compute how much water will be retained between these walls after rainfall.

### Prototype:

```python
def rain(walls):
    """
    Calculate the total amount of rainwater retained.

    Parameters:
    - walls (List[int]): A list of non-negative integers representing wall heights.

    Returns:
    - int: The total amount of rainwater retained.
    """
```
